  ## Description:
  This creates an Employee database and a simple interface for said database.  This is not a server, the database is created locally.

  ## Installation:
  Make sure that node is installed on your machine.  You also will need MYSQL. Then clone the git repo so you have the files locally. Use MySQL to run db\schema.sql and db\seeds.sql in that order to create a local database.

  ## Usage:
  To use the project, open a terminal and cd to the directory containing the project's server.js file.  Then type "node server.js".  A list of choices will be presented.  Use the arrow keys to navigate and enter to select.
